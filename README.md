This repository contains the configurations files I use both on Linux and macOS.

To install on a server run `make` or `make desktop` for a desktop environment.
Alternatively if you are on Debian system with curl installed, this should work:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scanf/config-files/master/bin/bootstrap-debian.sh | sh
