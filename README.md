This repository contains the configurations files I use both on Linux and
macOS.  Use this at your own risk and don't expect any support from me if you
break your default setup.

To install on a server run `make` or `make desktop` for a desktop environment.

Alternatively if you are on Debian system with curl installed, this should work:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scanf/config-files/master/bin/bootstrap-debian.sh | sh
