![Build Status](https://github.com/aalemayhu/dotfiles/actions/workflows/dockerimage.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains the ⚙️ configurations files I use both on Linux and
macOS.

Use this at your own risk and don't expect any support from me if you break
your default setup.

## Installing

Assuming you have already installed the essential build tools on your OS. You will need Ruby, git and make to be present.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scanf/dotfiles ~/src/github.com/scanf/dotfiles
cd ~/src/github.com/scanf/dotfiles
ruby bin/run.rb
```

Enjoy!
